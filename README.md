Beyond the textbook and lecture notes don't forget the manuals:

See the brief Makefile tutorial below.

## Step 1: `empty.s`

Use the textbook to create an `empty.s` program that you will use with the debugger.
You will want to add a Makefile so that when you run `make empty` the `empty` binary will be created from you `empty.s`
source file.

Note the following is are minimal commands you can use to assemble and link your code:

`as -g empty.s -o empty.o`
`ld -g empty.o -o empty`

### make and Makefiles

You may find the following brief tutorial helpful.  In general the Makefiles
we will create in this class can be very simple.  A simple makefile to automate
the tasks for this question might look like the following:


```
empty: empty.o
       ld -g empty.o -o empty
       
empty.o: empty.s
       as -g empty.s -o empty.o
```

If you put this into a file called `Makefile` then when you run `make empty` make will look at the time
stamps on the files to determine if something has changed and then run the specified commands to update
the things that depend on the changes.  Eg. The above make file says that the **target** file `empty` depends on the `empty.o`.
If `empty.o` is newer than `empty` then the rule will be executed to create a new version of `empty`.  Similarly if the second
stanza says that the target `empty.o` depends on `empty.s`.  If `empty.s` is newer than `empty.o` it will run the rule to
update `empty.o`.  In this way make will automte the task of running complex series of command depending on what
files have changed.


       
## Question 1: `q1.gdb`

Start gdb and issue the following commands to explore how to set and print the contents of a register (use the help command to understand what is happening eg. help p and help x):
Line 0: starts gdb and opens the empty ELF file

Line 1: sets a breakpoint to ensure that when we start a process from the ELF file it stops immediately

Line 2: starts a process from the ELF file so that we can start exploring the CPU and registers of the process

Remaining lines (3-10) demonstrate using set and print to modify and examine registers
```
00:$ gdb empty
01:(gdb) b _start
02:(gdb) run
03:(gdb) set $rax = 0b00000001
04:(gdb) p /x $rax 
05:(gdb) p /u $rax
06:(gdb) set $rbx = 0b00000010
07:(gdb) p /x $rbx 
08:(gdb) p /u $rbx
09:(gdb) set $rcx = 0b00001100
10:(gdb) p /x $rcx
11:(gdb) p /u $rcx
12:(gdb) set $rdx = 0b01100001
13:(gdb) p /x $rdx
14:(gdb) p /u $rdx
15:(gdb) p /c $rdx
16:(gdb) set $r8 = 0b01100010
17:(gdb) p /x $r8
18:(gdb) p /u $r8
19:(gdb) p /c $r8
```

After exploring the use of the gdb `set` command interactively with Gdb, use an editor create a file called `q1.gdb`
In this file, you will write the definition for a user defined Gdb function (a simple list of Gdb commands that you can invoke via the functions name) called q1.

### gdb user defined functions

gdb functions are just a way of defining  a set of gdb commands (that you would normally give at the gdb prompt)
as a sequence to be run when you give the name of the function. Eg.

```
# The hash symbol can be used to add comment lines
# Please add some to explain what your 'gdb' commands do
define myPrintRax
   p /x $rax
end
```

You an find more info about defining gdb user commands here:

https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Define.html#Define

### q1 gdb command
When run, your new `q1` gdb command should set the values of the registers so that the following is true

- `rax` = `0b1`
- `rbx` = `0b10`
- `rcx` = `0b1100`
- `rdx` = `0b01100001`
- `r8` = `0b01100010`

If correct you should be able to do the following with similar output

```
$ gdb empty
(gdb) source q1.gdb
(gdb) b _start
(gdb) run
(gdb) q1
(gdb) p/t { $rax, $rbx, $rcx, $rdx, $r8 }  
$1 = {1, 10, 1100, 1100001, 1100010}
(gdb) quit
```

You will find a bash script named `q1test.sh` that you can use to test your solution.
You are encouraged to examine it to see how it works.


## Question 2: `q2.gdb`

Your next task is to execute an operation. In particular, you will have your computer count the number of bits that are set to 1 in the value of the RAX register and place the result in RBX.
In this task, you will no longer use Gdb functionality to set the values of registers. Instead, you will "program" the computer to perform this operation. You will do that by writing an
assembly instruction to the memory of your computerr and then have your computer execute that instruction.

To do this you will need to write the bytes that correspond to the IA64 opcode for the popcnt instruction:
``` gas
  popcnt rbx, rax     
```

The opcode for this instruction is:
```
        0xf3, 0x48, 0x0f, 0xb8, 0xd8
```

You will need to have the CPU execute this instruction and then examine the register values to see if things look right.  You are encouraged to play around with this
by hand and then when you are convinced you know how things work write your `q2.gdb` file to automate things with a `q2` command.
Again there is a testting script, `q2test.sh`, that you should use to test your solution.  

**Now answer questions on gradescope**



### Hints
One of your registers is the `rip` register. The current value of `rip` tells the processor what is the location in memory of the opcode bytes that you want it to execute. 
As we did in the lecture you can use the following syntax to write a single byte value to a location in memory:
`set {unsigned char} (<address>)=<value>`

Where `<address>` is the memory locaion you want to update and `value` is the single byte value you want to wrtie. 

Gdb has a function called 'stepi'. This Gdb command directs Gdb to allow the processor to execute the instruction encoded at the memory location pointed to by the instruction pointer register
`rip`.  After writing your opcode values into memory, you will need to set the 'rip' value to the location of the opcodes and then use the `stepi` Gdb command to execute your instruction.
We suggest that you place your opcode bytes starting at address of your `_start` symbol in your empty program.  Remember you will need to make sure tha your `empty` binary has set aside enough space for the number of bytes you will need to write'

You will likely find the following useful:  

```
(gdb) help x 
```
 
A very useful feature of the Gdb examine memory command ('x') is that it can interpret the memory for you and print the byte values in various formats.
For example:

```
(gdb) x/16bx $rip     
```

prints 16 (b)ytes found at the memory address in the rip register in he(x)adecimal notation.
       
One very useful format is translating the memory bytes to assembly opcodes and printing the corresponding assembly instructions.  This ability is called disassembling -- going from opcodes to the human readable assembly instruction definitions from the CPU's manual.
For example `x/1i $rip` would decode enough bytes at the memory location currently pointed to by the instruction pointer that form one IA64 instruction.  Note to switch gdb to use the INTEL assembly format use
```
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
```

Here is an example 
```
(gdb) b _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401000
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/jovyan/work/UnderTheCovers-IM/assembly/CS400-F21-PS2/src/empty 

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401000 in _start ()
(gdb) x /5xb _start
0x401000 <_start>:      0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
(gdb) source q2.gdb
(gdb) q2
(gdb) x /5xb _start
0x401000 <_start>:      0xf3    0x48    0x0f    0xb8    0xd8
(gdb) x /1i _start
=> 0x401000 <_start>:   popcnt %rax,%rbx
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
(gdb) x /1i _start
=> 0x401000 <_start>:   popcnt rbx,rax
(gdb) p $rip
$1 = (void (*)()) 0x401000 <_start>
(gdb) x /1i $rip
=> 0x401000 <_start>:   popcnt rbx,rax
(gdb) 
```



With this in mind your `q2` gdb command should:
1. write the necessary bytes of your assembly instruction to the locations starting the `_start` address
2. then set the `rip` to `_start`, and
3. finally use the `stepi` command to execute the instruction.

You can test your `q2` command  by loading 'rax' ahead of running your `q2` coammdn and then examine the contents of `rbx` after to see if things look right.

## Question 3: `q3.gdb`

In this question we are going to put our new skills to the test with  bit of a puzzle.

The following is gdb ouput that this question will deal with.

```
(gdb) x /12xb _start
0x400078 <_start>:      0xf3    0x48    0x0f    0xb8    0xd8    0x48    0x89    0x1d
0x400080 <_start+8>:    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
(gdb)
```

### Step 0: Modify your `empty.s`

1. First  modify  your `empty.s` so that it leaves enough space at `_start` for the 12 bytes.
2. add the following option to your linker command in your Makefile:
```
--omagic
```

### Step 1: `q3.gdb` and testng with `q3test.sh`

1. Create a `q3.gdb` and define a `q3` gdb command that places the 12 values at the locatin of `_start`
2. Use `q3test.sh` to confirm that your q3.gdb is working correctly.

### Step3: **Answer gradescope questions**
